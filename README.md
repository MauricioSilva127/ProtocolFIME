Sometimes the worst part of letting go
Is when your heart starts losing hope
You feel a whole lot of nothing
But you gotta keep on running


When it seems like the love is gone
And you think you're on your own
Just take a look around
Open up your eyes, you see the love never dies


Oh, I know it's hard to say goodbye
But, baby, don't you cry, it's all a part of life
When you're alone and dakness fills the sky
My baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise
Ooh, baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise
Ooh, baby, don't you cry, 'cause the sun's gonna rise


You know the sun's gonna rise
My baby, don't you cry
Oh, the sun's gonna rise
